## August 2016

[Bookmark of the room meeting](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/august-2016-room-meeting).

### Agenda

1. Does the room/group need to be renamed to reflect the fact that it doesn't focus only on "Close" activity?
2. Do we need more *-pls options directly in the CV-PLS userscript?
3. What is the line for reporting 'all spam' or 'all bad suggested edits' for a particular user?
4. There's a fine line between talking about / trying to promote the room and... well, spamming and pissing people off. How do we / should we advertise the room? Does it make a difference if it's main or Meta? Should we have any guidelines on the matter?
5. Should SOCVR be involved in moderating the new Documentation portion of Stack Overflow?

### Resolutions

<!-- add this to each section -->
<!-- [Bookmark](link to topic start) -->

#### 1. Does the room/group need to be renamed to reflect the fact that it doesn't focus only on "Close" activity?

SOCVR is so ingrained that at this point it is impossible to change without confusion. Even though our reach has expanded close voting is still a major part of what we do. [We are a brand and it is not a issue](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/32059787#32059787) so we will not be changing the name.

#### 2. Do we need more *-pls options directly in the CV-PLS userscript?

Yes, [we want to do reject-pls](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/32059909#32059909) for suggested edits as trial [but we need to sit down and document the cases for such and then test](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/32059937#32059937). Candidates are: ties going the wrong way, obvious spam, rude, abusive and plagiarism.

#### 3. What is the line for reporting 'all spam' or 'all bad suggested edits' for a particular user?

[Unless posted by a moderator](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/32060084#32060084), [we will not post any links to users](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/32060005#32060005). This means no !!/allspam and no reject-all. Our rule is no links to a user profile.

#### 4. There's a fine line between talking about / trying to promote the room and... well, spamming and pissing people off. How do we / should we advertise the room? Does it make a difference if it's main or Meta? Should we have any guidelines on the matter?

Guideline: [If it is relevant to the conversation at hand, fine. If it is out of the blue then just don't do it](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/32060170#32060170).
That said, [on Main, you don't say anything unless someone directly asks. On Meta, you can give some details if SOCVR could be relevant/useful in a discussion.](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/32060212#32060212)

#### 5. Should SOCVR be involved in moderating the new Documentation portion of Stack Overflow?

We will only moderate Docs [for rude, abusive, spam and plagiarism](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/32060300#32060300). [There won't be any moderation of low-quality, off-topic or otherwise incorrect examples.](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/32060327#32060327)
