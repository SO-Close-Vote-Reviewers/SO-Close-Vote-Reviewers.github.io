# History

Let's face it. The Close Vote Queue on Stack Overflow is huge. It's a dauntingly large number. At one point, it was over 100k. It's a much tamer amount now, but it can feel like your contributions don't amount to anything. Hence the start of the
initiative to [start a Close Vote room back in 2013](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/251956).

The room originated as a meeting place once a week to handle your 40 allotted review tasks. The feeling to make a dent with a couple of fellow users worked as an incentive. The motivation to make a difference is still there.

We feel your pain. We want to help. Together, we can make a dent.
