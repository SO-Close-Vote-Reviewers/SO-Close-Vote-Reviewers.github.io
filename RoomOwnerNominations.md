# Room Owner Nominations #

Our chat room periodicly looks for new Room Owners.

We use an "application/interview" style for new Room Owners. The workflow works like this:

1. The RO team announces the expansion of the RO team
2. Chat members write up a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/) of their nomination. This must be written by the person running for the position.
3. Anyone is free to write comments on the nominations to provide feedback and ask questions.
4. When nominations close (usually a week later) the RO team will evaluate the nominations and choose a winner.

This page contains links to the different nominations to join the Room Owner team on SOCVR. Nominations are ordered by their nomination time, oldest first.
