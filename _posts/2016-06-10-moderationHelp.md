# Moderation Help

- My advice for new 3k'ers in the cv queue: filter on ONLY "unclear" and tags that you answer for the first 1-2 days. Then you can expand your filters until you get comfortable with the patterns of each close reason.  [source](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/conversation/new-cv-queue-advice)
