# What this Tour is

If you're from the [Home]({% post_url index.md %}) tab and you'd like to join SOCVR, read this tour and it will guides you what you have to know. Now, read below!


# What SOCVR is

The [SO Close Vote Reviewers](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers) is a team, the main goal of ours is that **close the bad questions as quickly as possible**.

And also, we deal with reopen voting, tag cleanup, burnination efforts, editing, coaching/commenting, delete voting, undelete voting, and other things about moderation.


Generally, we post and handle `[cv-pls]` requests in the chat room. It should be in the below format:

    [tag:cv-pls] The reason of why you're voting to close the question <link-to-the-question>

For example:

<sub>Tip: We have [an user-script to generates the `[cv-pls]` requests automatically](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/UserScripts#so-close-vote-request-generator).</sub>


Everyone can post `[cv-pls]` requests in the chat room when you think a question should be closed quickly. Here's the rules about the request - **always remember and follow them**:

- `[cv-pls]` should not be a habit for users. Don't make it an instinct to fast-track every eligible post to the front of the closure system; `[cv-pls]` is for posts that:
  - are really bad (low quality magnets)
  - are a bad example used to justify other crap
  - have recent activity on the question (Edits, VLQ/NAA answer)
  - don't have enough users in that tag to close the post in time

- Members are not expected to close vote any post you bring up. Furthermore, do not pressure anyone into doing so. cv-pls means “close vote please”, not “close vote or I'll stab you.”

- Avoid extended discussion about a `[cv-pls]`. We don't have to agree about a close request. We're not a democracy. However, users that are posting cv-pls'es that are blatantly wrong will be told so. The final verdict is on the RO team.

- Do not post feedback on success (or failure) of a cv-pls request. (I.e., no “boom”ing.)
